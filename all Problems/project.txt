///###required concepts for the project:-

	1 Program:-	static set of instructions written by the programer(normal code) is called as program
as a program is in human readable format it is not diractly exicutable.
	2 Toolchain:-	it is used to convert our human understandable program into a machin understandable process
	3 Process:-	running instance of a program is called as a process when we dubble click our .exe file
then it gets loadade into ram and it becomes a process
	4 Thread:-	it is considerd as a lite waight process a smallest part of a process is called as thread.
	5 DLL:-		it is called as Dynamic Link Libarary if contains the set of functions which can be called 
by any other process.
